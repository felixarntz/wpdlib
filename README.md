WPDLib (WordPress Definitely Library)
=====================================

This library is used and bundled by all _Definitely_ plugins for WordPress.

The library contains general functionality shared across all these plugins. You probably found your way here since you were looking at the code of one of the _Definitely_ plugins - or you're interested in learning more about their internals.

For a detailed guide and reference on how to use this library, please read the [Wiki on Github](https://github.com/felixarntz/wpdlib/wiki).

Contributions and Bugs
----------------------

If you have ideas on how to improve the library or if you discover a bug, I would appreciate if you shared them with me, right here on Github. In either case, please open a new issue [here](https://github.com/felixarntz/wpdlib/issues/new)!
